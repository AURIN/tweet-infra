On average 2.2GB of space are needed for every 1M tweets. Therefore, somew 200GB are neeed to hos the about 90M that have been harvested so far.
With a replica factor of 3, 6.6GB are needed for every 1M tweets, bringing the disk space for 200M tweets (a total that would be reached in a year or so) to 1.3TB.
